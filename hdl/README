In this directory you will find Hardware Description Language code which
implements the FPGA side of the CommFPGA protocol used by FPGALink devices. The
design is modular, vendor-neutral and implementations are provided in both VHDL
and Verilog.

Subdirectories:
  common - Makefiles needed to build the HDL code for Xilinx or Altera tools.
  sync - A synchronous CommFPGA implementation for the Cypress FX2LP.
  epp - A placeholder for an asynchronous implementation, emulating EPP.
