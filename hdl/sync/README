------------------- SYNCHRONOUS FIFO COMMFPGA IMPLEMENTATION -------------------

This directory contains Verilog and VHDL code implementing CommFPGA using a pair
of synchronous FIFOs, one for reading and one for writing. The Cypress FX2LP is
the canonical implementation, used in most Digilent, KNJN, Trenz and Opal Kelly
USB/FPGA devkits.

All of the code here is provided in both VHDL and Verilog. The netlist generated
from each is pretty much identical, so it really doesn't matter which one you
choose.

[vhdl|verilog]/comm_fpga:
    The actual CommFPGA HDL code, implemented in VHDL and separately in Verilog.
    You can just pick one and instantiate it in your code.

[vhdl|verilog]/ex_cksum:
    A very simple example project showing how to instantiate the CommFPGA module
    and wire it up so that each channel is wired to a simple register.

[vhdl|verilog]/ex_fifo:
verilog/ex_fifo
    A slightly more involved example showing how to wire the CommFPGA module to
    a pair of FIFOs.

platforms:
    Files describing the board-specific stuff (location constraints, etc).
