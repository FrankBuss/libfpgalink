A library for JTAG-programming and subsequently interacting with an FPGA over USB using a
microcontroller (primarily the Cypress FX2LP). It allows you to:

   * Load and save Cypress FX2LP firmware
   * Communicate with the FPGA using HiSpeed USB (~25Mbyte/s)
   * Reprogram the FPGA using JTAG over USB
   * Bootstrap an FPGA design standalone using minimal components

To build, first you need to install the MakeStuff Build Environment (http://bit.ly/k0ydbN) for your
platform, and then make sure that this directory is called "libfpgalink", and that it is in the
"libs" directory like this:

*** BUILDING ON WINDOWS ***

Prerequisites:
   * Visual Studio Express 2010 or 2008
   * SDCC 2.9.0 (http://bit.ly/k7wyYn)
   * Xilinx ISE WebPACK (http://bit.ly/bRf82e)

To build, just type "make deps". The build will download and install the things it needs.

*** BUILDING ON LINUX ***

Prerequisites:
   * sudo apt-get install g++
   * sudo apt-get install libusb-dev
   * sudo apt-get install sdcc
   * Xilinx ISE WebPACK (http://bit.ly/bRf82e)
