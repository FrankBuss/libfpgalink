A library for JTAG-programming and subsequently interacting with an FPGA over USB using a
microcontroller (primarily the Cypress FX2LP). It allows you to:

   * Load and save Cypress FX2LP firmware
   * Communicate with the FPGA using HiSpeed USB (~25Mbyte/s)
   * Reprogram the FPGA using JTAG over USB
   * Bootstrap an FPGA design standalone using minimal components

The project build assumes this directory ("libfpgalink") lives within a structure like this:

src

+-common
|
+-apps
|
+-libs

| +-neopurgo
