Calling FPGALink from Python

Linux:
  dd of=/var/tmp/foo.dat if=/dev/urandom bs=65536 count=160
  sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../linux/rel ./fpgalink.py ../../gen_xsvf/nexys2.xsvf /var/tmp/foo.dat 1443:0005

This connects to the device at 1443:0005 (hopefully a Digilent Nexys2), loads the onboard FX2 chip
with a new firmware, loads the nexys2.xsvf design into the board's FPGA, and then does some register
reads and writes. The changes to the board are lost on the next power cycle, so it's safe to try.

You can also use it in interactive mode:
  chris@wotan$ sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../linux/rel python
