Calling FPGALink from Excel VBA

This example sheet connects to the device at 1443:0005 (hopefully a Digilent Nexys2), loads the
onboard FX2 chip with a new firmware, loads the nexys2.xsvf design into the board's FPGA, and then
does some register reads and writes. The changes to the board are lost on the next power cycle, so
it's safe to try.

You may need to install the Visual C++ redistributable package. You can download it from Microsoft.

The C functions in the FPGALink DLL are wrapped in VBA functions in the FPGALink module.
