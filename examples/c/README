Calling FPGALink from C

Linux:
  make
  dd of=/var/tmp/foo.dat if=/dev/urandom bs=65536 count=160
  sudo linux/rel/c ../../gen_xsvf/nexys2.xsvf /var/tmp/foo.dat 1443:0005

This connects to the device at 1443:0005 (hopefully a Digilent Nexys2), loads the onboard FX2 chip
with a new firmware, loads the nexys2.xsvf design into the board's FPGA, and then does some register
reads and writes. The changes to the board are lost on the next power cycle, so it's safe to try.
