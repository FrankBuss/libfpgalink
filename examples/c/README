CALLING FPGALINK FROM "C"

The examples below assume your device is a 1200K Digilent Nexys2. For Atlys and
Nexys3, remove the "-p" option, replace "1443:0005" with "1443:0007" and choose
an appropriate CSVF file for your board.

    Usage: fpgalink [-hps] -v <VID:PID> [-i <VID:PID>] [-x <csvfFile>]
                    [-f <dataFile>]

    Load FX2LP firmware, load the FPGA, interact with the FPGA.

      -h             print this help and exit
      -p             FPGA is powered from USB (Nexys2 only!)
      -s             scan the JTAG chain
      -v <VID:PID>   renumerated vendor and product ID of the FPGALink device
      -i <VID:PID>   initial vendor and product ID of the FPGALink device
      -x <xsvfFile>  XSVF or CSVF file to play into the JTAG chain
      -f <dataFile>  binary data to write to register 0

In order to build the example code, you'll need to install the MakeStuff build
infrastructure from http://bit.ly/makestuff. Then you'll be able to build and
run the code like this:

$ make
$ dd of=/var/tmp/foo.dat if=/dev/urandom bs=65536 count=160
$ ./lin.x64/rel/c -i 1443:0005 -v 1443:0005 -p -s \
    -x ../../hdl/apps/makestuff/swled/cksum/vhdl/csvf/fx2all-nexys2-1200.csvf \
    -f /var/tmp/foo.dat

This connects to the device at 1443:0005 (hopefully a 1200K Digilent Nexys2),
loads the onboard FX2LP chip with a new firmware, loads the cksum example design
into the board's FPGA, and then does some channel reads and writes. The changes
to the board are lost on the next power cycle, so it's safe to try.
