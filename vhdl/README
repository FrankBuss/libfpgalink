FPGALINK VHDL REFERENCE DESIGN

The files in the ../gen_xsvf directory were built using this code/Makefile. By default it builds for
the 1200K Digilent Nexys2. To build for an alternative board you can just do:

make PLATFORM=x

Where x is "nexys2-500", "nexys2-1200", "s3board", "atlys" or "nexys3".

* The build requires the Xilinx WebPACK tools to be installed (http://bit.ly/xilinx-webpack).
* The "XILINX" environment variable must be set to the location of the installation
  (e.g "/opt/Xilinx/13.1/ISE_DS/ISE" or "C:\Xilinx\13.1\ISE"),
* The Xilinx ISE tools directory must be on your system PATH (e.g "${XILINX}/bin/lin64" or
  "%XILINX%\bin\nt").

NOTES
The "wbtc.exe" binary in Xilinx ISE WebPACK 13.1 appears to crash during the build process for some
reason. I think this is just the WebTalk thing that sends information about your design to Xilinx,
so it's safe to replace with something innocuous (and functional):

  cd %XILINX%\bin\nt\unwrapped
  mv wbtc.exe wbtc.exe.old
  printf "#include <stdio.h>\nvoid main() { printf(\"wbtc.exe was called\\n\"); }\n" > wbtc.c
  cl wbtc.c

Linux users who don't like being spied on can disable WebTalk too (32-bit users should remove the 64):

  cd ${XILINX}/bin/lin64/unwrapped
  sudo mv wbtc wbtc.old
  printf "#include <stdio.h>\nvoid main() { printf(\"wbtc.exe was called\\\n\"); }\n" | sudo tee -a wbtc.c
  sudo gcc -o wbtc wbtc.c
